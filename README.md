# Custom HashMaps in Ruby

A rebuilding of hashmaps in Ruby. Important to note that keys can only be strings.

- [x] `#hash(key)` -- takes a key and produces a hash code with it.
- [x] `set(key, value)` -- takes two arguments, the first is a key and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is overwritten or we can say that we update the key’s value (e.g. Carlos is our key but it is called twice: once with value I am the old value., and once with value I am the new value.. From the logic stated above, Carlos should contain only the latter value).
- [x] `#get(key)` -- takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If the key is not found, returns nil.
- [x] `#has?(key)` -- takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
- [x] `#remove(key)` -- takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return the deleted entry’s value. If the key isn’t in the hash map, returns nil.
- [x] `#length` -- returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
- [x] `#clear` -- removes all entries in the hash map.
- [x] `#keys` -- returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
- [x] `#values` -- returns an array containing all the values.
- [x] `#entries` -- returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: `[[first_key, first_value], [second_key, second_value]]`
